  </head><body><p>Hello Reader,</p>
<p>Welcome to HelperBlogger.com, A blogspot resources blog serving bloggers and blogspot users since last 6 years. HelperBlogger was formed through infinite passion towards blogging, writing and making something creative and useful by working around with the codes. As the times spends, I got busy in studies and as since the launch of HelperBlogger I am the only one to contribute to this blog as I was not sure about the content provided by the third parties or guests, so skip that thing but later I regretted it cause in my unavailability that thing would have helped me to keep this blog going, but from now onwards I am planning to enable guest posting that too only after checking the quality, usability and relativeness of content. In between I tried to bring HelperBlogger on track but could not due to my studies.</p>

<p>There is a lot has been changed throughout these years in this field so with the moving time we also need to move on, so we have decided to remove old non-working scripts and widgets or if possible modify them and make them usable again. Already I have started to update scripts but still I will recommend you to host scripts on your own reliable servers.</p>

<p><strong>Why still on Blogger platform?</strong></p>
<p>This question hits me again and again. Why I am yet on blogger? Should I switch to WordPress? And the answer was NO! There are few major reason because of which I am still on blogger, atleast as of now ;)</p>
</div>
<ol data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The very first reason is that it is a child of technology giant Google, maybe many of you do not agree with my statement but I do strongly believe in this thing that Blogger has a great back support.</li>
<li>Everything is yours: From changing font to changing whole theme everything under one code. This really impress me.</li>
<li>No web hosting costs: As currently we do not have any income source, Blogger was our primary choice.</li>
</ol>
<div data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the changes?</strong></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to enable Guest Posting on HelperBlogger</li>
<li data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately we had to delete almost all of the comments made after mid of 2014 as almost 90% of them was spam.</li>
<li data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">Old non-working widgets, outdated articles will be removed or if possible they will be updated with new scripts.</li>
<li data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: justify;">We have a brand new design for our blog. We are using a premium version of BPress.</li>
<li>We have moved to GoDaddy from BigRock, will write a article on it shortly.</li>
<li>We have enabled disqus as well as facebook comments along with default blogger commenting system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any suggestions on this are welcomed. You can contact me through my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.helperblogger.com/p/contact.html" rel="noopener" data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank">contact page</a>.</p>
<p>Till then, Good bye. Keep faith.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rahul.</p></body></html>
